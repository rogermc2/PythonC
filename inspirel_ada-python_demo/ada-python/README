This is a simple demo project that shows the principles of integration
between Ada and Python (here: Ada program calling Python script).

In order to compile this project execute:

$ gnatmake -Pada_main

As a result a simple Ada program will be created in the ./obj directory
that embeds the Python interpreter, imports an external Python script
(python_module.py) and uses functions defined in that script.

To run this program execute:

$ ./obj/ada_main

Note that the Ada program uses a very simplified package that encapsulates
the gory details of inter-language integration. This package is not intended
to be complete with regard to everything that can be done with Python and
it is expected that this package will be extended as appropriate.
